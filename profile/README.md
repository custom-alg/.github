# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my personal organization on GitHub. This space contains private repositories for personal and small-team projects.

- Purpose: A central place to host compact personal and team projects.
- Access: All repositories are private. If you require access to a specific project, contact me and I will grant the appropriate permissions.
- What you’ll see: Once access is provided, you will be able to view the repository and follow the project's development and progress.

To request access, please contact me via GitHub (e.g., send a message or open an issue) :)
