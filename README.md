# .github-repo

This is a **special repository** for the `custom-alg` organization on GitHub.

## What is this repository?

The `.github` repository has special meaning on GitHub. It serves as the organization's central hub for:

### 1. Organization Profile (`profile/README.md`)
The `profile/README.md` file is displayed on the organization's public profile page at [github.com/custom-alg](https://github.com/custom-alg). It's the first thing visitors see when they discover your organization.

### 2. Default Community Health Files
Files placed in this repository serve as defaults for **all repositories** in the organization that don't have their own. Supported files include:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | Community code of conduct |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contribution guidelines |
| `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` | Default issue templates |
| `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | Default pull request template |
| `SECURITY.md` | Security vulnerability reporting policy |
| `SUPPORT.md` | Support resources and documentation |
| `FUNDING.yml` | Sponsorship and funding information |

### 3. Reusable Workflow Templates
Create workflow templates in the `workflow-templates/` directory that team members can easily adopt across organization repositories.

### 4. Organization-wide Configurations
Centralized configurations that apply across the organization.

## Getting Started
